## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
This project is about creating numerous different styles of headers and footers that are static and animated. The purpose of this project is to gain knowledge on how to create headers and footers, and for sure, in the future, this will be really helpful because websites often use headers and footers, so having experience creating one will make it easier for me in the future.

The best key component of my project is having a dark mode. Since we weren't allowed to use Javascript, it was a lot harder to create. But thankfully, I managed to do it. I resourced multiple videos on YouTube and stitched them together to work. There is also a drop-down menu, which is helpful, especially when you have multiple navigations on your header. and a collapsing search bar, which I also found on YouTube.

The technologies that I used were HTML and CSS. I used HTML for the contents and structure of the website and CSS to design the contents in order for it to look good.

Hopefully, in the future I can learn how to make a responsive website that automatically adjusts depending on screen sizes.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
